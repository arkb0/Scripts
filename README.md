# Scripts 🛠️
A collection of short scripts and utilities. There is (currently) no unifying theme. The scripts are designed to be lightweight, adaptable, and easy to extend.

## Features ✨
- Handy one‑off scripts for everyday automation, fun proofs of concept, demos, etc.
- Minimal dependencies, straightforward usage

## Getting Started 🚀
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arkb0/Scripts.git
cd Scripts
```

Run scripts directly from the command line. Each script is self‑contained and documented with inline comments.

## Structure 📂
- **OSINT/** – utilities for open source intelligence workflows
- **GameAI/** - Game AI algorithm demos
- **LICENSE** – GPL‑3.0, ensuring freedom to use, modify, and share
